Java Interview questions and answers


1. What are the Pillars of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)?
The 4 Pillars of OOP:
Encapsulation is  to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is called a class in Java. Java Encapsulation is a way of hiding the implementation details of a class from outside access and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class.
 
inheritance we use to reuse all the property of parent in our child you can go with class and interface in the same type if it is a class class or interface interface you can go with extends if the type is different you can go with implements the next polymorphism
 
poly means single with multiple implementation okay which is nothing our overloading and overriding 
Method Overloading is a Compile time polymorphism. In method overloading, more than one method shares the same method name with a different signature in the class. In method overloading, the return type can or can not be the same, but we have to change the parameter because, in java, we can not achieve method overloading by changing only the return type of the method. 
 
Method Overriding is a type of runtime polymorphism. In method overriding, Method overriding is used to grant the specific implementation of the method which is already provided by its parent class or superclass.
 
// Overloading
void greet() {}
void greet(String name) {}
 
// Overriding
class Animal {
    void sound() {}
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
 
 
Abstraction is means hiding implementation  and showing functionality
Real-world Example (Encapsulation):
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Encapsulated field
 
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }
 
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}



2. Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface
Abstract class
Interface
1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
 
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
Interface supports multiple inheritance.
 
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
Interface has only static and final variables.
 
4) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.
Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
 
5) The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class.
The interface keyword is used to declare interface.
 
6) An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
An interface can extend another Java interface only.
 
7) An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends".
An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements".
 
Example:
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}
 
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}



3. Access Modifiers in Java
Modifier	Class	Package	Subclass	World
public	✔	✔	✔	✔
protected	✔	✔	✔	✖
default	✔	✔	✖	✖
private	✔	✖	✖	✖


3. Exception Handling:
 try-catch-finally
 The try block is used to specify a block of code that may throw an exception. The catch block is used to handle the exception if it is thrown. The finally block is used to execute the code after the try and catch blocks have been executed.
 
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This block always runs.");
}
· 
try: Contains risky code.
· 
· 
catch: Handles exceptions.
· 
· 
finally: Executes regardless of exception.
· 



5. Method Overloading vs Overriding
Feature	Overloading	Overriding
Class Relation	Same class	Parent-child classes
Method Signature	Must differ in parameters	Must be the same
Polymorphism Type	Compile-time	Run-time
Example:
// Overloading
void greet() {}
void greet(String name) {}
 
// Overriding
class Animal {
    void sound() {}
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}



6. Multithreading in Java
Real-world analogy: Ordering food in a restaurant (main thread) while cooking (another thread).

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}
 
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();
    }
}



7. Polymorphism in Java
· 
Compile-time Polymorphism (Overloading)
· 
· 
Run-time Polymorphism (Overriding)
· 
Example:
class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Shape");
    }
}
class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}



8. Purpose of static Keyword
Use Case	Explanation
Static variable	Shared among all objects
Static method	Can be called without an object
Static block	Runs once during class loading
Example:
class Counter {
    static int count = 0;
    Counter() {
        count++;
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}



9. How to handle Memory Management & Garbage Collector
· 
JVM manages memory using heap and stack.
· 
· 
Unreachable objects are cleaned by Garbage Collector (GC).
· 
MyObject obj = new MyObject();
obj = null; // Eligible for GC
System.gc(); // Suggest GC (not guaranteed)



11. Parent-Child Method Override in Java
class Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle starts");
    }
}
 
class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starts");
    }
}
· 
Overrides parent method using @Override.
· 
· 
Enables polymorphic behavior.
· 



12. Where Did You Use OOPs Concepts in Real Time?
Answer for interviews:
"In my real-time Spring Boot project for an e-commerce system:
· 
I used Encapsulation in DTOs and service layers.
· 
· 
Applied Inheritance for common response structures.
· 
· 
Used Abstraction via interfaces for service layers.
· 
· 
Implemented Polymorphism in payment handling where each payment mode had a different logic with a common method signature."
· 



13. Can You Override Static and Private Methods?
· 
Static methods: Cannot be overridden (they are class-level).
· 
· 
Private methods: Not accessible in subclass; cannot override.
· 
class A {
    private void show() {}
    static void greet() {}
}
class B extends A {
    // Not overriding, this is a new method
    private void show() {}
    static void greet() {}
}



14. What are the different access modifiers in Java, and what do they signify?
Already covered in Q3.



15. What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
Already covered in Q5.



16. Explain the concept of polymorphism in Java with an example.
Already covered in Q7.



17. What is the purpose of the 'static' keyword in Java? How is it used?
Already covered in Q8.
Here’s a simple explanation of the types of memory in Java:



�� 1. Heap Memory
· 
Used for: Objects and instance variables
· 
· 
Allocated at runtime using new keyword.
· 
· 
Managed by Garbage Collector (frees memory automatically).
· 
Student s = new Student(); // Stored in heap
✅ Big memory area, shared among all threads.



�� 2. Stack Memory
· 
Used for: Method calls, local variables
· 
· 
Follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out).
· 
· 
Each thread has its own stack.
· 
void greet() {
    int x = 10; // x is stored in stack
}
✅ Fast but limited in size.



�� 3. Method Area (MetaSpace in Java 8+)
· 
Stores: Class-level data, like:
· 
o 
Class definitions
o 
o 
Static variables
o 
o 
Method code (bytecode)
o 
✅ Shared among all classes.



�� 4. Program Counter (PC) Register
· 
Each thread has its own PC register.
· 
· 
Keeps track of the current instruction being executed.
· 
✅ Small memory block, used internally by JVM.



�� 5. Native Method Stack
· 
Used when Java code calls native (C/C++) code using JNI (Java Native Interface).
· 
· 
Stores native method information.
· 



✅ Summary Table:
Memory Type	Stores	Scope
Heap	Objects, instance variables	Shared
Stack	Local variables, method calls	Per thread
Method Area	Class info, static variables, bytecode	Shared
PC Register	Current executing instruction	Per thread
Native Method Stack	Native code info	Per thread


Let me know if you want a diagram or interview-focused Q&A on this topic!



✅ 1. Single Inheritance
· 
One class inherits from another.
· 
· 
Only one parent and one child.
· 
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}
 
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}
✅ Dog gets properties of Animal.



✅ 2. Multilevel Inheritance
· 
A class inherits from a class which itself inherits another class.
· 
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Animal eats"); }
}
 
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}
 
class Puppy extends Dog {
    void weep() { System.out.println("Puppy weeps"); }
}
✅ Puppy → inherits from Dog → inherits from Animal.



✅ 3. Hierarchical Inheritance
· 
Multiple classes inherit from one base class.
· 
class Animal {
    void eat() { System.out.println("Animal eats"); }
}
 
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}
 
class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() { System.out.println("Cat meows"); }
}
✅ Both Dog and Cat inherit from Animal.



�� 4. Multiple Inheritance (Not supported with classes)
· 
Java does not allow a class to inherit from more than one class (to avoid confusion called "Diamond Problem").
· 
// ❌ This will cause error
class A { }
class B { }
class C extends A, B { } // Not allowed



✅ 5. Multiple Inheritance with Interfaces (Supported)
· 
Java allows multiple inheritance through interfaces.
· 
interface A {
    void show();
}
 
interface B {
    void display();
}
 
class C implements A, B {
    public void show() { System.out.println("A's method"); }
    public void display() { System.out.println("B's method"); }
}
✅ Class C implements both A and B interfaces.



✅ Summary Table:
Type	Supported?	Example
Single Inheritance	✅ Yes	One class → another
Multilevel Inheritance	✅ Yes	A → B → C
Hierarchical	✅ Yes	A → B and A → C
Multiple (classes)	❌ No	A, B → C (Not allowed)
Multiple (interfaces)	✅ Yes	Interface A, B → Class C implements

�� Java String Interview Questions & Answers



14. How Many Ways Can We Create a String Object?

✅ Two Ways to Create Strings in Java
1️⃣ Using String Literals
* Stored in String Constant Pool (SCP)
String str1 = "Hello";
🔹 This is memory-efficient because identical literals point to the same SCP reference.

2️⃣ Using the new Keyword
* Stored in Heap Memory
* If interned, also stored in SCP
String str2 = new String("Hello");
🔹 This always creates a new object in the heap, even if the string value already exists in the SCP.

💡 Interview Tip:  String literals save memory by using the String Constant Pool, where identical strings share the same reference.

Let me know if you'd like this formatted as a flashcard or expanded with examples involving .equals(), ==, or intern()—those make great follow-ups!


15. String Object Creation Scenarios
String s1 = "Java";               // Literal – SCP
String s2 = new String("Java");   // Object in heap + literal in SCP
String s3 = s1.intern();          // Returns reference from SCP
�� Memory Usage:
· 
s1 == s3 → true
· 
· 
s1 == s2 → false
· 

16. Why Is String Immutable in Java?
Strings in Java are immutable, meaning that once a String object is created, its content cannot be changed. Any operation that appears to modify a String actually results in the creation of a new String object with the altered content. This design choice offers several significant advantages: 
�� Reasons:
· 
Security: Used in ClassLoader, URL, etc.
· 
· 
Thread-safety: Can be shared across threads without sync.
· 
· 
HashCode caching: Ideal for keys in HashMap.
· 
· 
ClassLoader behavior: Prevents hacking via reflection.
· 
String s = "Hello";
s.concat("World");  // Original string not modified
System.out.println(s);  // Outputs: Hello



17. == vs .equals() in String
Comparison	Purpose	Compares
==	Reference check	Memory address
.equals()	Value/content check	Actual string value

String str1 = "hello";
String str2 = "hello";
String str3 = new String("hello");

// Using == to compare references
boolean result1 = str1 == str2;  // true, because they refer to the same instance in the string pool
boolean result2 = str1 == str3;  // false, because str3 is a new object with a different memory address

String str1 = "hello";
String str2 = "hello";
String str3 = new String("hello");

// Using .equals() to compare content of strings
boolean result1 = str1.equals(str2);  // true, because their contents are the same
boolean result2 = str1.equals(str3);  // true, even though str3 is a different object



18. How to Write a Custom Immutable Class
final class Employee {
    private final String name;
    private final int id;
 
    public Employee(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
 
    public String getName() { return name; }
    public int getId() { return id; }
}
✔️ Rules:
· 
Class must be final
· 
· 
Fields must be private & final
· 
· 
No setters
· 



19. Which Is Better for Storing Passwords: String or char[]?
�� Answer: char[] is better
Why?
· 
Strings are immutable → Cannot be wiped from memory
· 
· 
char[] can be cleared manually
· 
char[] password = {'p', 'a', 's', 's'};
Arrays.fill(password, '0');  // Clear sensitive data



20. What Is a Marker Interface? Can You Create One?
�� Marker Interface = No methods, just a “marker”
Example: Serializable, Cloneable
public interface MyMarker {}
�� JVM or frameworks check the presence of this marker using instanceof.

✅ What is a Marker Interface in Java?
A marker interface is an empty interface — it has no methods or fields.
Its purpose is to mark a class so that the JVM or libraries can detect it and apply special behavior.

Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object's state into a byte stream. This byte stream can then be stored in a file, transmitted over a network, or saved in a database, allowing for object persistence and transfer across different platforms. 

Deserialization is the reverse process of converting a byte stream back into an object in memory, effectively reconstructing the original object.


✅ Examples in Java:
Marker Interface	Purpose
Serializable	Tells JVM that a class can be serialized (converted to a byte stream)
Cloneable	Indicates that Object.clone() is allowed
Remote	Used in RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
✅ Why Use a Marker Interface?
* To signal or tag a class for a specific capability.
* Used internally by frameworks or the JVM for type checking at runtime using instanceof.

✅ How to Create a Marker Interface
// Marker Interface
interface Important { }

// Class using marker
class MyClass implements Important {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("I am marked as Important!");
    }
}
You can now check it like:
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        
        if (obj instanceof Important) {
            System.out.println("This object is marked as Important.");
        }
    }
}

✅ Key Points
* Marker interfaces are empty.
* Used for type-checking and behavior tagging.
* Can be replaced in modern Java by annotations, but still useful in some cases.

Let me know if you'd like an example with Serializable or a real-world use case of marker interfaces.




21. How to Use Mutable Classes? Difference Between String ,  StringBuffer and StringBuilder

Here’s a simple and clear comparison between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java:

✅ 1. String
* Immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
* Every time you modify it, a new object is created.
String str = "Java";
str += " World";  // Creates a new String object
* Thread-safe? ❌ No
* Performance: ❌ Slower if doing lots of changes

✅ 2. StringBuffer
* Mutable (can be changed)
* Thread-safe: ✅ Synchronized methods (good for multi-threaded environments)
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Java");
sb.append(" World");  // Same object modified
* Thread-safe? ✅ Yes
* Performance: ⚠️ Slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization

✅ 3. StringBuilder
* Mutable
* Not thread-safe: ❌ No synchronization
* Faster than StringBuffer in single-threaded programs
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Java");
sb.append(" World");  // Same object modified
* Thread-safe? ❌ No
* Performance: ✅ Fastest (best for single-threaded code)

✅ Summary Table:
Feature	String	StringBuffer	StringBuilder
Mutable	❌ No	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Thread-safe	❌ No	✅ Yes (Synchronized)	❌ No
Performance	❌ Slowest	⚠️ Moderate	✅ Fastest
Use Case	Fixed text	Multi-threaded edits	Single-threaded edits
🔔 When to Use?
* ✅ Use **String** → When data won’t change (e.g., constants, messages).
* ✅ Use **StringBuffer** → When multiple threads modify string.
* ✅ Use **StringBuilder** → When one thread modifies string a lot.

Let me know if you'd like a memory diagram or a performance test example!

Feature	StringBuffer	StringBuilder
Thread-safe	Yes	No
Performance	Slower (sync overhead)	Faster (no sync)
Use case	Multi-threaded apps	Single-threaded apps
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Java");
sb.append(" World");
System.out.println(sb);  // Java World



22. Singleton Design Pattern
�� Ensures only one instance exists.
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
 
    private Singleton() {} // private constructor
 
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
✅ Used in: Logging, DB connection pools, Configuration.



23. What Is a Marker Interface? (Recap)
Same as Q20 — marker interface is an interface with no methods, used to tag or mark a class with a metadata signal for the JVM or frameworks.



24. How to Convert String to Array and Use It
✅ How to Convert a String to an Array in Java — with Simple Examples
There are 3 common types of conversions:

🔹 1. String to Character Array (char[])
String str = "Java";
char[] charArray = str.toCharArray();

for (char ch : charArray) {
    System.out.println(ch);
}
🔸 Use when: You want to work on each character separately.

🔹 2. String to String Array using .split()
String str = "Java is awesome";
String[] words = str.split(" ");  // Split by space

for (String word : words) {
    System.out.println(word);
}
🔸 Use when: You want to break the string by words, comma, or any delimiter.
String csv = "apple,banana,grape";
String[] fruits = csv.split(",");

🔹 3. Convert String of Numbers to Integer Array
String str = "1,2,3,4,5";
String[] parts = str.split(",");
int[] numbers = new int[parts.length];

for (int i = 0; i < parts.length; i++) {
    numbers[i] = Integer.parseInt(parts[i]);
}
🔸 Use when: You want to process numbers stored as a string.

🧠 Bonus: Convert Character Array Back to String
char[] arr = {'J', 'a', 'v', 'a'};
String str = new String(arr);
System.out.println(str);  // Output: Java

✅ Summary Table
Task	Code Example
String → char[]	str.toCharArray()
String → String[] (words)	str.split(" ")
CSV → int[]	Integer.parseInt(str.split(","))
char[] → String	new String(charArray)
Let me know if you'd like a diagram or a real-world use case (e.g., CSV parsing)!




25. What is SCP and How Does It Work?
�� SCP = String Constant Pool
· 
Special memory area inside Method Area (before Java 8) or Heap (Java 8+)
· 
Avoids creating duplicate strings
· 
Uses intern() to reuse strings
· 
String a = "Java";
String b = "Java";
System.out.println(a == b); // true (same reference)



26. Which one is good to store password in Java: String or char[], and why?
✅ Answer: char[]
Reason: String is immutable – stays in memory and cannot be wiped. char[] can be cleared after use, offering better security.



27. How to Use Mutable Class? Difference Between StringBuffer and StringBuilder
Already covered in Q21.



✅ Summary Table for Quick Revision:
Question	Core Idea	Use in Interviews
String creation	SCP vs Heap	Memory optimization
Immutability	Thread safety, hash caching	Design justification
Mutable usage	StringBuilder for performance	Real-world coding
== vs .equals()	Reference vs value	Bug avoidance
char[] over String	Security in password mgmt	Best practices
Marker interface	No methods, just metadata	Advanced OOP
Singleton	Controlled instantiation	Design pattern question

⚠️ Java Exception Handling Interview Questions & Answers



1. What Is an Exception and Its Hierarchy?
�� Exception: An unwanted or unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow of a program.
�� Exception Hierarchy:
Object  
 └── Throwable  
      ├── Error            (e.g., OutOfMemoryError)
      └── Exception  
           ├── RuntimeException (unchecked)  
           └── IOException, SQLException, etc. (checked)
Type	Description
Checked Exception	Known at compile-time (e.g., IOException)
Unchecked Exception	Known at runtime (e.g., NullPointerException)
Error	Serious issues like OutOfMemoryError

￼
�� Interview Tip: Unchecked = RuntimeException & its subclasses.



2. How to Write a Custom Exception?
✅ Use when built-in exceptions aren't enough.

class InvalidAgeException extends Exception {
    public InvalidAgeException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
 
public class Test {
    public static void checkAge(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
        if (age < 18)
            throw new InvalidAgeException("Age must be 18 or above.");
    }
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            checkAge(16);
        } catch (InvalidAgeException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}



3. throw vs throws Keyword
Feature	throw	throws
Purpose	To explicitly throw an exception	To declare an exception
Usage	Inside a method	In method signature
Syntax	throw new Exception();	void method() throws Exception
Count	Only one exception at a time	Can declare multiple exceptions
Example:
void validate(int age) throws InvalidAgeException {
    if (age < 18)
        throw new InvalidAgeException("Not valid age");
}



4. try, catch, finally
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Division by zero not allowed");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup done");
}
Block	Purpose
try	Code that might throw exception
catch	Handles exception
finally	Runs always (cleanup, resource closing)


5. final, finally, and finalize() – What’s the Difference?
Keyword	Type	Purpose
final	Modifier	Makes variable constant, method un-overridable, class un-inheritable
finally	Block	Executes always after try-catch
finalize()	Method	Called by GC before object destruction (deprecated in Java 9+)
Example:
final int x = 10;
 
try {
    // risky code
} finally {
    System.out.println("Always runs");
}
 
@Override
protected void finalize() {
    System.out.println("Cleanup before GC");
}



6. How Does Exception Handling Work in Java? Explain try-catch-finally Block.
�� Java uses a try-catch-finally mechanism for error handling.
Flow:
1. 
Code in try runs
2. 
3. 
If exception occurs → control goes to matching catch
4. 
5. 
finally block runs regardless
6. 
Real-World Example: File Reader
public void readFile(String path) {
    BufferedReader reader = null;
    try {
        reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));
        System.out.println(reader.readLine());
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        try {
            if (reader != null)
                reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error closing file.");
        }
    }
}
�� Interview Tips:
· 
finally is mostly used to release resources.
· 
· 
Only one catch block is executed even if multiple exist.
· 



✅ Summary Table for Quick Revision
Question	Focus	Example
Exception Hierarchy	Checked vs Unchecked	IOException, NullPointerException
Custom Exception	User-defined error handling	InvalidAgeException
throw vs throws	Code vs declaration	throw new, throws IOException
try-catch-finally	Safe execution flow	Resource cleanup
final, finally, finalize	Different meanings	Const, cleanup, GC
Exception Handling Flow	Real use cases	File I/O, DB, etc.


�� Java Multithreading Interview Questions & Answers



1. What is Multithreading in Java?
�� Multithreading is the concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize CPU utilization.
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running in thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}
✅ Benefits:
· 
Better resource utilization
· 
· 
Improves app responsiveness
· 
· 
Used in games, servers, UI apps
· 



2. Synchronized Block vs Synchronized Method
Here’s a simple and clear comparison of Synchronized Block vs Synchronized Method in Java:

Synchronized Method:
* Scope: The entire method is synchronized. This means that only one thread can execute this method at a time for a given object instance (or for the class in the case of a static synchronized method). 
* Locking:
    * For instance methods, the lock is acquired on the this object (the instance of the class containing the method).
    * For static methods, the lock is acquired on the Class object representing the class itself. 
* Usage: Suitable when the entire method's logic needs to be protected from concurrent access. 
* Synchronized Block:
* Scope: Only a specific section of code within a method is synchronized.
* Locking: The lock is acquired on the object specified within the parentheses after the synchronized keyword. This can be any object, including this, a specific instance variable, or a dedicated lock object.
* Usage:
    * When only a part of a method requires synchronization, allowing other parts of the method to be executed concurrently.
    * When you need to synchronize on an object other than this (or the class object for static methods). This offers more fine-grained control over locking.
*   


✅ Synchronized Method
* You lock the entire method.
* Once one thread enters the method, others must wait until it finishes.
* The lock is on the object (for instance methods) or class (for static methods).
🧠 Good for: When the whole method’s logic needs to be thread-safe.
Example Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine a bathroom with a "Do Not Disturb" sign on the whole room — only one person can enter and use all facilities.

✅ Synchronized Block
* You lock only a specific block of code inside a method.
* Offers better performance, as only the critical section is locked.
* You can lock on this or a specific object.
🧠 Good for: When only part of the method needs to be synchronized.
Example Real-Life Analogy:
Inside the bathroom, only the mirror is reserved for one person at a time, but others can still use the rest.

🔸 Comparison Table:
Feature	Synchronized Method	Synchronized Block
Lock Scope	Entire method	Specific part of method
Flexibility	Less flexible	More flexible
Performance	May block unnecessarily	More efficient (minimal locking)
Lock Target	this or class (implicitly)	this or any given object (explicit)
Let me know if you'd like to see when to choose one over the other or a visual diagram!

// Synchronized method
public synchronized void print() { ... }
 
// Synchronized block
public void print() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // critical section
    }
}

In Java, there are 3 main ways to create a thread, and optionally a 4th advanced way using thread pools. Here's a simple and interview-friendly explanation:

✅ 1. By Extending Thread Class
* Override the run() method.
* Use when you don’t need to extend another class (since Java allows only one superclass).
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running via Thread class");
    }
}

new MyThread().start();

✅ 2. By Implementing Runnable Interface
* Recommended when your class needs to extend another class.
* You pass the Runnable to a Thread object.
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running via Runnable interface");
    }
}

new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();

✅ 3. Using Callable and Future (with ExecutorService)
* When you want a thread to return a result or throw an exception.
* Used with ExecutorService.
Callable<String> task = () -> "Callable thread result";
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);
System.out.println(future.get());  // Output: Callable thread result
executor.shutdown();

✅ 4. Using ExecutorService / Thread Pools
* Recommended in real-world apps for managing many threads efficiently.
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Thread via ExecutorService"));
executor.shutdown();

🧠 Summary for Interviews:
Method	Return Value	Supports Exceptions	When to Use
Thread (extends Thread)	No	No	Simple, but not flexible
Runnable (implements Runnable)	No	No	Preferred for basic threads
Callable + Future	Yes	Yes	When result or exception is needed
ExecutorService	Optional	Yes	Best for large-scale thread management
Let me know if you want visual diagrams or real-time use case examples for any of these!



4. Types of Threads in Java
Type	Description
User Thread	Keeps JVM alive
Daemon Thread	Background service (e.g., GC)
Thread t = new Thread();
t.setDaemon(true);



5. Purpose of join() Method
�� Waits for a thread to finish before continuing execution.
t1.join(); // waits until t1 completes
✅ Use case: Load screen waits for data to finish loading.



6. What is Synchronization?
�� A mechanism to control thread access to shared resources.
synchronized(obj) {
    // only one thread can execute at a time
}
✅ Prevents race conditions, ensures data consistency.



7. Difference Between wait() and sleep()
Feature	wait()	sleep()
From class	Object	Thread
Releases lock	Yes	No
Use case	Coordination	Pause execution
obj.wait(); // Must be inside synchronized block
Thread.sleep(1000); // Pause for 1 second



8. Difference Between start() and run()
Method	Description
start()	Creates a new thread & calls run()
run()	Executes in the current thread
thread.start(); // New thread
thread.run();   // Executes in main thread



9. What is Deadlock?
�� Deadlock occurs when two threads hold a lock and wait for each other's lock.
// Thread A locks obj1, waits for obj2
// Thread B locks obj2, waits for obj1
�� Avoid using nested locks and always acquire locks in the same order.



10. What is ThreadPoolExecutor?
�� Used to manage a pool of threads efficiently (from java.util.concurrent).
ExecutorService pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
pool.execute(() -> System.out.println("Task"));
✅ Better than creating threads manually – efficient resource usage.



11. What is Thread Priority?
�� Controls the order of execution preference.
thread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY); // 10
�� Note: It doesn't guarantee execution order – depends on OS.



12. What is volatile and transient keyword?
Keyword	Purpose
volatile	Ensures visibility across threads
transient	Prevents field from serialization
volatile boolean flag = true;
transient String password;



13. What is ExecutorService?
�� A framework to manage thread execution.
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Run task"));
executor.shutdown();
✅ Simplifies task submission & thread lifecycle.



14. What is False Sharing?
�� Performance issue in multithreading where threads modify variables that reside on the same cache line, causing cache invalidation.
�� Rare in Java but important in high-performance systems.



15. Why Use String Immutability? (Revisited)
�� Strings are immutable to:
· 
Enable string pooling
· 
· 
Ensure thread-safety
· 
· 
Support secure usage (e.g., passwords, class loading)
· 



16. How to Handle Thread Interruption?
public void run() {
    while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
        // do work
    }
}
➡️ Use Thread.interrupt() to request stop
thread.interrupt();



17. Difference Between yield() and sleep()
Here’s a clear and simple difference between yield() and sleep() in Java:

✅ 1. yield()
* Purpose: Suggests to the Thread Scheduler that the current thread is willing to pause to let other threads of the same priority run.
* Does NOT block the thread — just a hint, not guaranteed.
* The thread can be rescheduled immediately.
🧠 Real-Life Analogy: You’re at a coffee machine and say, "Anyone want to go first?" If no one does, you continue.

✅ 2. sleep()
* Purpose: Forces the thread to pause execution for a specific time (in milliseconds or nanoseconds).
* The thread definitely stops and enters the TIMED_WAITING state.
* The thread won’t run again until the sleep time is over, even if the CPU is free.
🧠 Real-Life Analogy: You take a nap for 5 minutes. You’re not getting up before the alarm.

🔸 Comparison Table
Feature	yield()	sleep()
Purpose	Suggest to pause voluntarily	Forcefully pause for fixed time
Time Control	No — resumes immediately if chosen	Yes — pauses for specified time
Guarantees Pause?	No — only a hint	Yes — always pauses
Thread State	Ready-to-run	TIMED_WAITING
InterruptedException	Not thrown	Can throw InterruptedException


18. How to Implement Thread-Safe Singleton?
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;
 
    private Singleton() {}
 
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized(Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
✅ Uses Double-Checked Locking + volatile for thread-safety.



19. When to Use volatile Over synchronized?
Keyword	Use When
volatile	Just need visibility across threads
synchronized	Need atomicity & visibility
✅ Use volatile for status flags, stop signals



✅ Summary Table (Quick Recap)
Concept	Key Insight
synchronized	Controls thread access to resources
join()	Waits for another thread
wait() vs sleep()	Releases lock vs pause
start() vs run()	New thread vs current thread
ExecutorService	Manages thread lifecycle
volatile	Ensures visibility (lightweight)
Deadlock	Avoid nested locking
Thread pool	Efficient resource usage
Singleton	Double-checked locking pattern


[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[                  {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{                    }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}]                     ]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
    

✅ What is volatile?
The volatile keyword in Java is used to ensure visibility of changes to variables across threads.

🔹 Simple Explanation:
* When one thread changes the value of a volatile variable, other threads immediately see the updated value.
* Without volatile, threads might read a cached (old) value instead of the updated one.

🧠 Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine two coworkers (threads) looking at a whiteboard (shared variable).
* If it's volatile, every time one writes a new value, the other sees it instantly.
* Without volatile, one might keep looking at a sticky note (cache) instead of the whiteboard.

🔹 Real-World Use Case:
Let’s say you have a background thread running:
volatile boolean running = true;
* If the main thread sets running = false, the background thread immediately sees the change and can stop safely.

Here's a simple and interview-friendly explanation of the transient keyword in Java:

✅ What is transient?
The transient keyword is used to exclude a variable from serialization.

🔹 Easy Explanation:
* When you serialize an object (convert it into a byte stream to save or send), all its fields are saved.
* If a variable is marked as transient, it won’t be saved during serialization.
* When deserialized, that variable gets a default value (e.g., null, 0, false).

🧠 Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine you’re photocopying (serializing) a form — If a field is marked "Do not copy" (transient), that section will be left blank on the copy.

🔹 Why Use It?
* To protect sensitive data (like passwords, credit card numbers).
* To skip temporary fields that don’t need to be stored or transferred (like logs, cache).
* To avoid serializing non-serializable objects.
✅ Interview-Friendly Example (Spoken):
"If I have a User class and I don't want the user's password to be saved when I serialize the object, I mark the password field as transient. That way, when the object is written to a file or sent over the network, the password is not included."

Let me know if you'd like to pair this with a real coding example or a typical interview trap question!

✅ Syntax:
(parameter) -> expression
Real-world usage: Runnable, event handling, collections.



3. What is the Stream API in Java 8?
➡️ Stream API is used to process collections in a declarative (functional) style.
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
names.stream().filter(n -> !"B".equals(n)).forEach(System.out::println);
✅ Benefits:
· 
Reduces boilerplate
· 
Easy parallel processing
· 
Lazy & optimized

· 
4. Optional Class in Java 8
✅ Used to avoid NullPointerException.
Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(null);
System.out.println(name.orElse("Default"));
✔️ Why use?
· 
Safe null handling
·  
Encourages clean API

5. Java 8: default and static Methods in Interfaces

🔹 1. Default Method
🧩 What is it?
A method in an interface with a default implementation.

✅ Why Use It?
To add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
👇 Example:
interface Vehicle {
    void start();  // abstract method

    default void fuelType() {
        System.out.println("Default fuel type is Petrol.");
    }
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car is starting...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car c = new Car();
        c.start();           // Output: Car is starting...
        c.fuelType();        // Output: Default fuel type is Petrol.
    }
}

🔹 2. Static Method
🧩 What is it?
A static method defined in an interface.

✅ Why Use It?
To define utility/helper methods related to the interface, without needing an object.
👇 Example:
interface VehicleUtils {
    static int getMaxSpeed() {
        return 180;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int speed = VehicleUtils.getMaxSpeed();  // Call using interface name
        System.out.println("Max Speed: " + speed);  // Output: Max Speed: 180
    }
}

🧠 Interview-Friendly Summary:
"Java 8 allows us to write default methods in interfaces to provide a common implementation, and static methods to define utility methods. This helps keep code backward-compatible and more organized."



6. New Date and Time API
�� java.time (Inspired by Joda-Time)
LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
✅ Benefits:
Immutable
· 
Thread-safe
· 
ISO 8601 standard

7. Method References
➡️ Shorthand for lambda when calling existing methods.
list.forEach(System.out::println); // instead of: s -> System.out.println(s)
✅ Types:
· 
Class::staticMethod
· 
· 
obj::instanceMethod
· 
· 
Class::new (constructor ref)
· 



8. What is a Functional Interface?
A Functional Interface in Java is an interface that has only one abstract method.
➡️ It can have default or static methods, but only one abstract method.

🔹 Why Are They Important?
They are used to implement lambda expressions and method references, introduced in Java 8.
💡 Java provides many built-in functional interfaces in java.util.function package like Predicate, Function, Consumer, etc.

🧠 Real-Life Analogy:
Think of a functional interface like a contract with one responsibility — like a remote with only one button that does one specific thing.

✅ How to Create a Functional Interface?
Use the @FunctionalInterface annotation (optional but recommended for compile-time checking).

👇 Code Example:
@FunctionalInterface
interface Greet {
    void sayHello(String name);
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using Lambda Expression
        Greet greeting = (name) -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
        greeting.sayHello("Roy");  // Output: Hello, Roy
    }
}

🧠 Key Points for Interview:
Feature	Details
Only One Abstract Method	Must (required for lambda support)
Can Have Default Methods	✅ Yes
Can Have Static Methods	✅ Yes
Used With	Lambda expressions, method references
Annotation (@FunctionalInterface)	Optional, but helps avoid errors

🗣 Interview Summary Line:
“A functional interface has exactly one abstract method, making it ideal for lambda expressions. It's a key part of functional programming in Java 8.”

· 



9. Java Stream Operations: filter, map, reduce
These are core stream operations used for processing collections in a functional way.

🔹 1. filter()
Used to select elements that match a condition.
🔸 Think: "Keep only those elements that pass a test."
✅ Example:
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);

// Filter even numbers
List<Integer> evens = numbers.stream()
                             .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                             .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(evens);  // Output: [2, 4, 6]

🔹 2. map()
Used to transform elements.
🔸 Think: "Convert each element into something else."
✅ Example:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Roy", "Robert", "Java");

// Convert each name to uppercase
List<String> upperNames = names.stream()
                               .map(String::toUpperCase)
                               .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(upperNames);  // Output: [ROY, ROBERT, JAVA]

🔹 3. reduce()
Used to combine all elements into a single result.
🔸 Think: "Reduce a list into one value (sum, product, etc.)."
✅ Example:
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);

// Sum of all numbers
int sum = numbers.stream()
                 .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);

System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 10

🧠 Interview Summary:
"filter() selects elements, map() transforms them, and reduce() combines them into one result. These are powerful tools for processing collections using Java Streams."

🔄 Visual Flow:
Original List -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)  → [2, 4, 6]
map(n -> n * 10)         → [20, 40, 60]
reduce(0, sum)           → 120



10. Difference Between Java 7 and Java 8
Feature	Java 7	Java 8
Functional	No	Yes (Lambda, Streams)
Interface	Abstract methods only	Default/Static methods allowed
Date API	Mutable, error-prone	Immutable, thread-safe
Optional	Not available	Available


11. Future vs CompletableFuture in Java
Both are used for asynchronous programming — running tasks in the background and getting results later.

🔹 1. What is Future?
* Introduced in Java 5.
* Represents a result of an asynchronous computation.
* You submit a task and then block using .get() to retrieve the result.
✅ Example:
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

Future<String> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return "Hello from Future!";
});

System.out.println(future.get());  // Blocks until result is ready
executor.shutdown();

🔹 2. What is CompletableFuture?
* Introduced in Java 8.
* Supports non-blocking, chained, and callback-based programming.
* You can combine multiple async tasks, handle errors, and use lambda syntax.
✅ Features:
* thenApply(), thenAccept(), thenCombine(), exceptionally()
* Truly async and composable
✅ Example:
CompletableFuture<String> completable = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    return "Hello from CompletableFuture!";
});

completable.thenAccept(result -> System.out.println(result));  // Non-blocking

🧠 Key Differences (Interview Table):
Feature	Future	CompletableFuture
Introduced In	Java 5	Java 8
Blocking	Yes (get() blocks)	No (can be non-blocking)
Chaining Tasks	❌ Not supported	✅ Yes (thenApply, thenAccept, etc.)
Combining Multiple Tasks	❌ Hard	✅ Easy with thenCombine, allOf, etc.
Exception Handling	❌ Try-catch manually	✅ exceptionally(), handle()
Reactive Programming	❌ No	✅ Yes
🗣 Interview Summary:
"Future is basic and blocking; CompletableFuture is modern, flexible, and supports true async programming with task chaining, callbacks, and better error handling."
Let me know if you’d like real-time use cases or combined examples!




12. Can a Functional Interface Extend Another?
Yes, a functional interface can extend another functional interface, as long as it does not declare more than one abstract method (total).

🧠 Easy Rule:
To remain a functional interface, the child interface must still have only one abstract method — including any it inherits.

🔹 Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine:
* One base interface called Work with doTask().
* A new interface RemoteWork that inherits doTask() and doesn't add any other abstract method — ✅ it’s still a functional interface.

✅ Example:
@FunctionalInterface
interface Work {
    void doTask();
}

@FunctionalInterface
interface RemoteWork extends Work {
    // No new abstract method added — still functional
}
➡️ You can use it with a lambda:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RemoteWork job = () -> System.out.println("Working remotely!");
        job.doTask();  // Output: Working remotely!
    }
}

❌ Not Allowed Example:
@FunctionalInterface
interface A {
    void methodA();
}

@FunctionalInterface
interface B extends A {
    void methodB();  // ❌ Now B has 2 abstract methods: methodA + methodB
}
🔴 This will cause a compile-time error if you still annotate B with @FunctionalInterface.

🗣 Interview Summary:
“Yes, a functional interface can extend another as long as it doesn’t introduce more abstract methods. The total must still be one abstract method to stay functional.”

Let me know if you want a diagram or real-time use case!



13. Functional Interfaces in Java 8
Interface	Purpose
Predicate<T>	Takes T, returns boolean
Function<T,R>	Takes T, returns R
Supplier<T>	Returns T, takes nothing
Consumer<T>	Consumes T, returns nothing


14.  map() vs flatMap() in Java Streams
Both are used to transform data in a Stream, but they work differently when it comes to nested structures like lists of lists.

🔹 1. What is map()?
Used to transform each element of a stream into something else.
📌 Input → Output: 1-to-1 mapping.

✅ Example:
Convert list of names to uppercase:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Roy", "Robert");

List<String> upperNames = names.stream()
                               .map(String::toUpperCase)
                               .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(upperNames);  // Output: [ROY, ROBERT]

🔹 2. What is flatMap()?
Used to flatten nested streams (e.g., a list of lists) into a single stream.
📌 Input → Output: 1-to-many mapping, then flattened into a single stream.

✅ Example:
Flatten a list of list of numbers:
List<List<Integer>> numbers = Arrays.asList(
    Arrays.asList(1, 2),
    Arrays.asList(3, 4)
);

// Flatten to a single list
List<Integer> flatList = numbers.stream()
                                .flatMap(list -> list.stream())
                                .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(flatList);  // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

🧠 Interview Summary Table:
Feature	map()	flatMap()
Use Case	Transform data	Flatten nested structures
Return Type	Stream<T>	Stream<T> (from Stream<Stream<T>>)
Mapping	1-to-1	1-to-many + flatten
Example Input	List	List<List>
🗣 Interview Summary:
“Use map() when you want to transform each element. Use flatMap() when each element is itself a stream or collection and you want to flatten the result into a single stream.”

Let me know if you want a diagram or real-world analogy to remember this better!



15. Stream vs Parallel Stream
Here’s a simple and interview-friendly explanation of Stream vs Parallel Stream in Java — with real examples to make it easy to understand:

✅ What’s the Difference: Stream vs ParallelStream?
Feature	Stream (Sequential)	Parallel Stream
Execution	One thread (main thread)	Multiple threads (splits tasks)
Performance	Slower (for big data)	Faster (for CPU-heavy operations)
Use case	Simple or small tasks	Large collections / CPU-bound tasks
Thread-safe?	No	Must be used carefully
🔹 1. Stream (Sequential)
Processes elements one-by-one using a single thread.
✅ Example:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Roy", "Robert", "John");

names.stream()
     .forEach(name -> System.out.println(name + " - " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
🟢 Output (single thread):
Roy - main
Robert - main
John - main

🔹 2. Parallel Stream
Splits the data and processes it using multiple threads from the ForkJoinPool.
✅ Example:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Roy", "Robert", "John");

names.parallelStream()
     .forEach(name -> System.out.println(name + " - " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
🔄 Output (multi-threaded):
Roy - ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1
Robert - main
John - ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3

🧠 When to Use Parallel Stream?
✅ Use when:
* Large collections
* CPU-intensive tasks
* No shared mutable state (i.e., thread-safe)
❌ Avoid when:
* Tasks are small or IO-heavy (overhead > performance gain)
* You modify shared variables (may cause issues)

🗣 Interview Summary:
“Stream works sequentially with one thread, while parallelStream() splits the data and processes using multiple threads — offering faster performance for large, CPU-heavy tasks. But use it only when thread-safety and task nature allow.”

Let me know if you’d like a visual diagram or a real-world analogy (like restaurant kitchens)!



16. Intermediate vs Terminal Operations
🔹 Intermediate Operations
* These are operations that transform a stream into another stream.
* They are lazy, meaning they don’t process data immediately.
* Instead, they build up a pipeline of operations to be executed later.
* You can chain multiple intermediate operations.
* Examples include: filter(), map(), sorted(), distinct()
Think of intermediate operations as setting up a recipe but not cooking yet.

🔹 Terminal Operations
* These are operations that trigger the processing of the stream pipeline.
* Terminal operations produce a result or side effect like a value, collection, or printing.
* Once a terminal operation is called, the stream is considered consumed and can’t be reused.
* Examples include: forEach(), collect(), reduce(), count()
Think of terminal operations as actually cooking the recipe and serving the food.

Type	Description	Example
Intermediate	Lazy operations, return stream	filter(), map(), flatmate, distinct , sorted, skip , limit
Terminal	Trigger execution, return result	forEach(), collect(), reduce , count


17. Exposure to Lambda Functions
✅ Used in:
· 
Threads: new Thread(() -> {})
· 
· 
Collections: stream().map()
· 
· 
Events: button.setOnClickListener(() -> {})
· 
Example:
Comparator<String> comp = (a, b) -> a.length() - b.length();



18. How Do You Use the New Date and Time API?
LocalDate today = LocalDate.now();
LocalDate dob = LocalDate.of(1995, Month.JUNE, 25);
Period age = Period.between(dob, today);
 
System.out.println("Age: " + age.getYears());



19. Purpose of forEach in Java 8
Used to iterate collections in a functional way.
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
list.forEach(System.out::println);



19. Method References (Revisited)
Lambda vs Method Ref:
list.forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));     // Lambda
list.forEach(System.out::println);            // Method ref

1. What collections have you used in your project?
Answer: In most of my projects, I have used:
· 
ArrayList, LinkedList for ordered data.
· 
· 
HashSet, TreeSet for unique collections.
· 
· 
HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap for key-value pairs.
· 
· 
ConcurrentHashMap in multi-threaded environments.
· 
· 
PriorityQueue for queue-based processing.
· 



2. Difference between List and Set?
Feature	List	Set
Duplicates	Allows	Not allowed
Ordering	Maintains insertion order	No guaranteed order (except LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)
Common Impl.	ArrayList, LinkedList	HashSet, TreeSet


3. Custom ArrayList that doesn’t allow duplicates
class CustomArrayList<E> extends ArrayList<E> {
    @Override
    public boolean add(E e) {
        if (!this.contains(e)) {
            return super.add(e);
        }
        return false;
    }
}



4. Why Set doesn’t allow duplicates?
Sets use equals() and hashCode() to check for uniqueness. If two objects return true for equals(), only one is retained.



5. Difference between Comparable and Comparator
Comparable	Comparator
1) Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.	The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
2) Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.	Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
3) Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.	Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
4) Comparable is present in java.lang package.	A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
5) We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.	We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.



6. Fail-Fast vs Fail-Safe Iterator
A iterator which will fail fast when we do any modifications while iterating a collection is called fail fast iterator ex: array list , hashmap, and vector (ConcurrentmodificationExcpetion)

Iterator who allow us to modify in middle while iterating a collection is called non fail fast iterator ex: copyonwritearraylist , copy on write array set , concurrent hashmap

Feature	Fail-Fast	Fail-Safe
Throws Exception	Yes (ConcurrentModificationException)	No
Examples	ArrayList, HashMap	CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap


7. Why use ConcurrentHashMap?
· 
Allows concurrent reads and writes.

Uses internal segmentation or lock stripping.

Safer and faster than synchronizing a HashMap.


✅ What is ConcurrentHashMap in Java?
ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe variant of HashMap designed for high concurrency.

🔹 Key Points:
* Allows multiple threads to read and write without blocking each other unnecessarily.
* Uses fine-grained locking (called lock striping) instead of locking the entire map.
* Improves performance in multi-threaded environments compared to synchronized HashMap or Hashtable.
* Doesn’t allow null keys or values.

8. Internal Working of HashMap & HashSet
· 
HashMap: Uses array of buckets; keys are hashed to determine bucket index. Handles collisions using linked list or tree (Java 8+)
HashSet: Backed by HashMap internally. Elements are stored as keys.

Here’s a clear and simple explanation of the internal working of HashMap and HashSet in Java, including memory structures, method flow, and collision handling.

🔹 1. Internal Working of HashMap<K, V>
A HashMap stores key-value pairs and is based on the concept of hashing for fast access.
🔸 Step-by-Step How put(key, value) Works:
1. hashCode() is called on the key.
2. HashMap computes an index using: index = (n - 1) & hash   // where n is the capacity of the array
3. 
4. It checks the bucket (array slot) at that index:
    * If empty, inserts a new Node<K,V>.
    * If not empty (collision):
        * Uses equals() to check if key already exists.
        * If yes, it updates the value.
        * If not, adds the new node to the end (as a LinkedList or Tree).
5. In Java 8+, if there are more than 8 entries in one bucket and the array size is ≥ 64, the LinkedList is converted to a Red-Black Tree for faster lookup.
🔸 How get(key) Works:
1. Calculate hashCode() and find index.
2. Go to that bucket:
    * If one node → return value.
    * If multiple (chained list or tree) → use equals() to find correct key.

🔹 2. Internal Working of HashSet
A HashSet uses HashMap<E, Object> internally to store elements.
🔸 Key Concept:
private transient HashMap<E, Object> map;
private static final Object PRESENT = new Object();
When you call:
set.add("apple");
It actually does:
map.put("apple", PRESENT);
So, it inherits all behaviors of HashMap — hashing, collisions, etc.

🔸 Why No Duplicates in HashSet?
Because HashMap does not allow duplicate keys — so when put() is called with an existing key, it replaces the value (no duplicate is added).

✅ Summary Comparison:
Feature	HashMap<K, V>	HashSet<E>
Purpose	Stores key-value pairs	Stores unique values only
Underlying DS	Array + LinkedList / Tree	Uses HashMap<E, Object>
Collision Handling	LinkedList / Tree (Java 8+)	Same as HashMap
Null Allowed	One null key, many null values	One null element
Duplicate Check	Based on key’s equals() and hashCode()	Based on element’s equals() and hashCode()
🔍 Real-World Analogy:
* HashMap → A locker room with labeled lockers (keys). You can store a name tag and item inside (key + value).
* HashSet → Just the labels on lockers (you don’t care about the item inside — dummy object).

9. Difference between HashMap and TreeMap
Feature	HashMap	TreeMap
Ordering	No order	Sorted by key (natural or comparator)
Null Keys	One allowed	Not allowed
Performance	Faster	Slower (Red-Black tree)

Here's a simple and clear explanation of the difference between HashMap and TreeMap in Java:

✅ HashMap vs TreeMap — Side-by-Side Comparison
Feature	HashMap	TreeMap
Ordering	❌ No order (random or hash-based)	✅ Sorted by keys (natural or custom order)
Underlying Structure	Hash Table (Buckets + LinkedList/Tree)	Red-Black Tree (Self-balancing BST)
Performance	✅ Faster (O(1) average for get/put)	❌ Slower (O(log n) for get/put)
Allows null key?	✅ Yes (only one null key allowed)	❌ No (NullPointerException if key is null)
Thread-safe?	❌ No (use Collections.synchronizedMap)	❌ No (same here)
Use Case	When speed matters, no need for order	When sorted keys are required
Implements	Map, Cloneable, Serializable	NavigableMap, SortedMap, Map
🔹 Code Example: HashMap
Map<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
hashMap.put("Banana", 20);
hashMap.put("Apple", 10);
hashMap.put("Cherry", 30);

System.out.println(hashMap);
// Output may be random: {Banana=20, Cherry=30, Apple=10}

🔹 Code Example: TreeMap
Map<String, Integer> treeMap = new TreeMap<>();
treeMap.put("Banana", 20);
treeMap.put("Apple", 10);
treeMap.put("Cherry", 30);

System.out.println(treeMap);
// Output sorted by key: {Apple=10, Banana=20, Cherry=30}

✅ When to Use What?
* 🟢 Use HashMap:
    * When you need fast lookup, insertion, and deletion
    * Key ordering doesn't matter
* 🟢 Use TreeMap:
    * When you need keys sorted automatically
    * When working with range queries, like sub-maps or head/tail maps

Let me know if you'd like:
* A visual diagram
* A performance benchmark
* Or TreeMap with custom comparator example



10. What is a WeakHashMap?
A WeakHashMap is a special implementation of the Map interface where the keys are stored as weak references. That means:
If a key is no longer referenced anywhere else in your program, it can be garbage collected, even if it's still in the map.

11. ArrayList vs LinkedList
Here's a clear and simple comparison of ArrayList vs LinkedList in Java — perfect for interviews or practical use:

✅ ArrayList vs LinkedList — Side-by-Side Comparison
Feature	ArrayList	LinkedList
Underlying Data Structure	Dynamic Array	Doubly Linked List
Access Time (get)	✅ Fast (O(1)) – index-based	❌ Slow (O(n)) – must traverse from head/tail
Insertion Time (add at end)	✅ Fast (amortized O(1))	✅ Fast (O(1))
Insertion in Middle	❌ Slow (O(n)) – needs shifting elements	✅ Fast (O(1) if position is known)
Deletion	❌ Slow – needs shifting	✅ Fast – just change links
Memory Usage	🟢 Lower (only data stored)	🔴 Higher (stores data + two pointers per node)
Search by Index	✅ Very fast	❌ Slower
Better For	Random access, less insert/delete	Frequent add/remove, sequential access
Thread-safe?	❌ No	❌ No
🔹 Example Code
🔸 ArrayList
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("A");
list.add("B");
System.out.println(list.get(1)); // Fast random access
🔸 LinkedList
List<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
list.add("A");
list.addFirst("Z");  // Fast insert at beginning
list.removeLast();   // Fast remove at end

✅ Real-World Analogy:
Concept	ArrayList	LinkedList
Analogy	Like an array of boxes in memory	Like a train with wagons linked together
Insert/Delete	Hard to insert in middle (need shifting)	Easy to link/unlink wagons
Access	Jump directly to any box	Must walk through train to reach a wagon
🧠 When to Use What?
* ✅ Use ArrayList when:
    * You need fast random access
    * More reads, fewer inserts/deletes in middle
* ✅ Use LinkedList when:
    * You frequently insert or delete elements
    * Don't need fast random access

Let me know if you'd like:
* A performance comparison chart
* Memory diagram showing structure of each
* Interview-style real-world use case question



12. equals() and hashCode() contract
· 
equals(): Compares object content.
· 
· 
hashCode(): Returns hash value.
· 
Contract: If two objects are equal using equals(), they must have same hashCode().



13. What is ConcurrentModificationException?
Thrown when a collection is modified structurally while iterating.
Use iterator.remove() or use concurrent classes like CopyOnWriteArrayList.

✅ What is ConcurrentModificationException in Java?
ConcurrentModificationException is a runtime exception thrown when a collection (like ArrayList, HashMap, etc.) is modified while it's being iterated in a way that is not allowed.

🔥 Example That Causes It:
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("A");
list.add("B");

for (String item : list) {
    if (item.equals("A")) {
        list.remove(item);  // ❌ Modifying the list during iteration
    }
}
Output:
Exception in thread "main" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException

⚙️ Why Does It Happen?
Internally, collections like ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap use a modCount variable (modification count).
* When you iterate, the iterator remembers the modCount.
* If you modify the collection directly (e.g., remove() from the list) while iterating, it detects a mismatch in modCount and throws this exception.

✅ How to Avoid It
🔹 1. Use Iterator’s remove() method
Iterator<String> it = list.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    String item = it.next();
    if (item.equals("A")) {
        it.remove();  // ✅ Safe
    }
}
🔹 2. Use CopyOnWriteArrayList (for multi-threaded cases)
List<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
* Allows safe modification during iteration
* But has performance cost (copies the list on every write)
🔹 3. Collect items first, remove later
List<String> toRemove = new ArrayList<>();
for (String item : list) {
    if (item.equals("A")) {
        toRemove.add(item);
    }
}
list.removeAll(toRemove);  // ✅ Safe after iteration

        1. What is super class of all object in java ?
A. Object is a all super class


33. Return type of Void method?
void means no return value. In generics, Void can be used as a placeholder.



34. Java 8 or Java 17?
Java 8 introduced lambdas, streams. Java 17 is LTS with records, sealed classes, pattern matching.



21. Which Java version have you worked on?
Specify: e.g., Java 8, Java 11 LTS, Java 17 LTS, Java 21.



22. Which Java framework is used for multithreading?
Java concurrency utilities: java.util.concurrent package — Executor Framework, ThreadPoolExecutor, Futures.



23. Which Executor Services have you used?
Examples: FixedThreadPool, CachedThreadPool, ScheduledThreadPool.



24. Types of Executor Service & Usage
· 
newFixedThreadPool(int n) – fixed threads
· 
· 
newCachedThreadPool() – flexible, reuses threads
· 
· 
newSingleThreadExecutor() – single thread
· 



25. What are thread pools? Have you used Cached Thread Pool?
Thread pools manage a group of reusable threads to perform tasks efficiently. CachedThreadPool creates new threads as needed and reuses idle threads.



26. New Fixed Thread Pool and New Fixed Executor
Both refer to Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int n) creating a fixed-size thread pool.



27. Different types of queues in Java, SynchronousQueue?
· 
ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue
· 
· 
SynchronousQueue – no internal capacity; handoffs directly between producer and consumer threads.
· 


9. What is the return type of different List interface methods?
Examples:
· 
add(E e) – boolean
· 
· 
get(int index) – E
· 
· 
remove(int index) – E
· 
· 
size() – int
· 
· 
iterator() – Iterator
· 


 
## 2. What is the difference between execution in Executor Framework?
 
| Method          | Description                                          | Return Type |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `execute(Runnable)` | Submits a task for execution, no result returned. | void        |
| `submit(Runnable/Callable)` | Submits a task and returns a `Future` representing the result or status. | Future<?> |
 
**Example:**
 
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
 
executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Run task"));
 
Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    return 123;
});
Integer result = future.get();  // Blocks until done



3. What is a BlockingQueue?
· 
A thread-safe queue that blocks producer threads when full and consumer threads when empty.
· 
· 
Used for producer-consumer patterns.
· 
Common Implementations:
· 
ArrayBlockingQueue
· 
· 
LinkedBlockingQueue
· 
· 
PriorityBlockingQueue
· 
· 
SynchronousQueue (special case with zero capacity)
· 
Example:
BlockingQueue<String> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);
queue.put("item");       // Blocks if full
String item = queue.take(); // Blocks if empty



4. How do we know thread pool is exhausted or has empty thread?
· 
Use ThreadPoolExecutor methods:
· 
o 
getActiveCount() returns number of threads currently executing tasks
o 
o 
getPoolSize() returns current number of threads in the pool
o 
· 
When active count equals max pool size, the pool is exhausted.
· 
ThreadPoolExecutor executor = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
int active = executor.getActiveCount();
int max = executor.getMaximumPoolSize();
 
if (active == max) {
    System.out.println("Thread pool exhausted");
}

Interview coding test questions


Great question! This is a classic Java interview puzzle about try-catch-finally and return statements.

🧪 Code:
public int test() {
    try {
        int result = 10 / 0;
        return result;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        return 1;
    } finally {
        return 2;
    }
}

🔍 Explanation:
* 10 / 0 → throws ArithmeticException
* Control goes to the catch block → returns 1
* But then finally block overrides the return and returns 2

✅ Final Output: 2

🧠 Interview Tip:
“If both catch and finally have return statements, the return from finally overrides everything else — even exceptions or returns from try and catch blocks.”
Let me know if you want a version where finally doesn't return, so you can compare!

Great question! This is a frequently asked Java interview question related to String creation and memory management.

🧪 Code:
String str1 = "ra";
String str2 = new String("ra");

✅ How Many Objects Will Be Created?
🔹 1. String str1 = "ra";
* This will create 1 object in the String Pool if "ra" is not already there.
* If "ra" is already in the pool, no new object is created.

🔹 2. new String("ra")
* This always creates a new object in the heap, regardless of whether "ra" exists in the pool or not.
* It also checks if "ra" is in the pool:
    * If not present: it adds 1 more object to the pool.
    * But since "ra" was already created in step 1, no new pool object is created here.

✅ Final Answer:
* 1 object in the String Pool
* 1 object in the Heap
🔹 Total: 2 String objects

🧠 Interview Summary:
“String str = "ra" uses the String pool. new String("ra") creates a new heap object even if the string exists in the pool. So, total 2 objects are created — 1 in the pool and 1 in the heap.”
Let me know if you'd like a memory diagram for this!


Great question! You're testing inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism in Java.

🧪 Given Code:
public class A {
    A() { }

    public void init() {
        System.out.println("a");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    B() { }

    public void init() {
        System.out.println("b");
    }
}
📌 Test Class:
A a = new B();
a.init();

🔍 What Happens?
1. A a = new B();
    * You are creating an object of B, but referencing it using a variable of type A.
    * This is runtime polymorphism.
2. a.init();
    * Even though a is declared as type A, the actual object is of type B.
    * So, the overridden init() method in class B is called.

✅ Output:
b

🧠 Interview Summary:
“Even though the reference is of type A, since the actual object is of type B and init() is overridden, Java uses dynamic dispatch to call B's version of the method.”
Let me know if you want constructor execution flow or to add super.init() as well!


Great! Let's explore your question: "Can we apply overloading to the above example, and what will be the output?"

🔁 First: Quick Recap of Overriding vs Overloading
Concept	Overriding	Overloading
Method name	Same	Same
Parameters	Same	Different
Inheritance	Required (child overrides parent)	Not required
Runtime or Compile-time	Runtime (polymorphism)	Compile-time (method resolution)
🔧 Modified Code with Overloading:
public class A {
    A() { }

    public void init() {
        System.out.println("A");
    }

    public void init(String msg) {
        System.out.println("A: " + msg);
    }
}

class B extends A {
    B() { }

    @Override
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("B");
    }

    public void init(int value) {
        System.out.println("B value: " + value);
    }
}

✅ Test Class:
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A a = new B();     // Reference type is A, object is B
        a.init();          // calls overridden method in B
        a.init("hello");   // calls method in A (String version)
        
        // a.init(10);     // ❌ Compile-time error: A doesn't have init(int)
        
        // To access init(int), you must cast:
        ((B) a).init(10);  // ✅ Safe cast, object is really B
    }
}

📤 Output:
B
A: hello
B value: 10

🧠 Interview Summary:
“Overloading depends on reference type at compile time, while overriding depends on actual object at runtime. So a.init() calls B’s version (override), but a.init(int) fails unless casted, because A doesn’t declare it.”
Let me know if you want the same logic with constructors or static methods too!
