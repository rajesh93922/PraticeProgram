9.SOLID Principles in Programming

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend upon abstractions, not concretions
